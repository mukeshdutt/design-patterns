# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Structure

- **AbstractProduct**: Declares an interface for a type of product object.
- **ConcreteProduct**: Defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory.
- **AbstractFactory**: Declares an interface for operations that create abstract product objects.
- **ConcreteFactory**: Implements the operations to create concrete product objects.
- **Client**: Uses only interfaces declared by `AbstractFactory` and `AbstractProduct`.
