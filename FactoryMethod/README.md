 <!--Factory Method-->

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Factory Method is very similar to simple Factory design pattern and it is mostly used when we need only one class
of instance at one time from those classes who are implemented same interface.
